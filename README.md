Hy,

That is my first code !

It was for Openclassrooms first project of the complete training.

After courses on HTML5 et CSS3 i had to integrate a model in thoses language froml scratch.

In fact, it was so hard at times !

Your brain isn't prepare to that !

It is like a batism...

I explained my actions on each commands in the code.

Thank!
Eric
