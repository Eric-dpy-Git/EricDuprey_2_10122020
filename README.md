Hy,

That is my first code !

It was for first project of the complete training of Web developer Openclassrooms

After courses on HTML5 et CSS3 i had to integrate a model in thoses language froml scratch.

In fact, it was so hard at times,

Your brain isn't prepare to that...

It is was like a batism... and i was very happy to did that and now, i know it's what i want to do !

I explained my actions on each commands in the code.

Thank!
Eric
